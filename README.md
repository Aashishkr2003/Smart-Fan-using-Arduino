# Project on Smart Fan using Arduino and DHT22 sensor

The smart fan project utilizes temperature and humidity sensors to automatically adjust fan speed for optimal comfort. By integrating these sensors, the fan can 
dynamically respond to changes in environmental conditions, ensuring efficient and personalized airflow in any room. Through a user-friendly interface, individuals can 
also customize settings and monitor real-time data for enhanced comfort and energy efficiency.

## Description

The DHT22 sensor communicates with microcontrollers using a custom 40-bit single-wire digital protocol. It initiates communication with a start signal, followed by the 
transmission of temperature, humidity, and checksum bits. The microcontroller decodes the data, performs a checksum verification, and converts the raw readings into 
physical units. This reliable protocol enables accurate temperature and humidity monitoring in diverse applications.

## Use Cases
## Industrial: Protection of goods in warehouses, optimization of growing conditions in greenhouses, and maintenance of optimal conditions in data centers.
## Residential: Personalized comfort in bedrooms, living rooms, and moisture control in bathrooms.
## Educational: Comfortable learning environments in classrooms with improved air quality.
